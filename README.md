ðŸš€ Project Highlight: Udemy Clone Webpage 
ðŸš€ Iâ€™m thrilled to share a recent project I worked onâ€”a Udemy Clone designed with HTML and CSS Flexbox!

In this project, I recreated a responsive, modern version of the Udemy homepage. Leveraging the power of Flexbox, I ensured the webpage adjusts effortlessly across various devices, from desktops to smartphones. This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in responsive design, CSS Flexbox, and crafting user-friendly interfaces.

Highlights of the Udemy Clone: 
ðŸ”¹ Fully adaptive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens 
ðŸ”¹ Layout built entirely with Flexbox for dynamic and flexible elements 
ðŸ”¹ A clean, professional homepage inspired by Udemyâ€™s interface
